Introduction

The aim of the program is to scan the website: https://coinmarketcap.com/ 
Every specified period of time we check the fluctuations and if they are greater than selected by you percent, the program will send us an e-mail with an appropriate notification.


How to use: 

1.The first step is to download my code.

2.Open the file functions.py and look at the 10 lines. You have to create a new file and paste the path to it in this line. 

IMPORTANT!!!   

In this file, place the following data in separate information:

-your e-mail

-your password

-e-mail where you want to send information about change price

-level of price change you are interested in (total, positive value)  

-time interval between price change checks

I've included some examples of cryptovalutes in the file url.py. If you want to add any cryptocurrency, go to the website https://coinmarketcap.com/, selet cryto which interesting you, click and copy link and paste to file url.py.

Run the program, it will work until you send an e-mail.
